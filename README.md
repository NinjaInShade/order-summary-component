## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I can't lie, I learnt nothing really here. I just practiced my responsive skills and semantic HTML. One thing I did was the mobile design was designed for 375px, but I felt was very squished, so just below that breakpoint, I changed the subscription plan section with the pricing and plan to a column layout to account for even smaller screens.
